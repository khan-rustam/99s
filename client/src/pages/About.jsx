                <p className=' sm:w-[45%] w-full'>In 1928, three years before the birth of civil aviation in India, the first Flying Club opened at Bombay to civilians. Aviation, still at its infancy, was male-oriented and only a few daring ladies ventured to wing their way across the Indian skies. Lady Dinshaw Petit and Rodahben Sawhney, sisters of J.R.D. Tata, the father of civil aviation in India, took to flying for fun. Although a few women were members of Bombay Flying Club, they were unknown to each other. A visit in 1965 by Isabelle McCrae, an American Ninety-Nine, triggered off the idea to form an association. In 1967, Chanda Budhabhatti, founder President, Rabia Futehally and Mohini Shroff with Mangala Joshi, Kumudini Rawal and Dr. Sunila Bhajekar formed the Indian Women Pilots Association, a non-profit body with its headquarters in Bombay - the fifth national association of its kind in the world.</p>
